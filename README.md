# Reddit theme
tumblr theme inspired by reddit's layout

This theme features a "rules" section, mimicking the one on reddit. This is useful for rp blogs, advice blogs, or fansites and can be customized.
To edit them, add your rules on the customize panel under "extra box content" and use the following format as a guide:<br>
&lt;ol&gt; <br>
&lt;li&gt;1.  First rule&lt;/li&gt; <br>
&lt;/ol&gt; <br>
You don't have to use this section this way. You can use it for online/visits counters, extra description, images, etc, by replacing the rule list with whatever content you want.
There is also a textbox to change the label for this section. 

<b>Adding links:</b>
All extra links are available in the last section of the sidebar. You can add as many as you want by adding a new page and selecting "show a link to this page". This works with external URLs as well.
